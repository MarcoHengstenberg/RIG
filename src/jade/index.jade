            This project was created out of the frustration in working with so many other CSS frameworks. Of course every framework has it's good and bad parts. This framework is the try to leverage those good parts on a very fundamental level. <br>
            The main concept behind RIG is simplicity and just provide as much as you actually need without putting you on the spot of adopting a certain look & feel that many frameworks bring with them.
