## 25.Sept.2014

Finally pushed the first Things online. Feel free to download the first version of RIG Framework and take a look at the rig.html file. This is the first release and only covers small ground. It's a reworked version of our grid system and some basic styling for many common elements. You could see it as a very basic CSS boilerplate

### Features

- Basic Values for many HTML5 Elements
- Gridsystem 
- First initial Documentation

## TODOS

There are several things to do to make RIG super awesome. This ToDo List will mostly cover things that will be tackled in the next upcoming releases.

- Form Elements
- Build System ( Now I build it using CodeKit, but will provide a build script for gulpjs)
- Extended Documentation
- GitHub Page for RIG ( Currently you'll find a HTML page in the root folder)
