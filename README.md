## Building

If you want to build the `rig.css` file on your own with your preferences, you can do so easily as this version of rig now supports gulp.

For installing all the dependencies be sure to have the latest version of `npm` installed on your system. Then using the Terminal go to the root folder of this project and type:

```
$ npm install
```

Once everything is installed, go ahead and run gulp from the command line.

```
$ gulp build
```

This will build all sass files and output a new file called `rig-build.css`
